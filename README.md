# ðŸš€ Project: Simple NASA API

### Goal: Enable your user to enter a date and return the picture/video of the day from NASA's API

I completed the challenge: 5

I feel good about my code: 4

The introduction to APIs is exciting. Updated and added CSS on 10.05.21. I did stuggle with the days inwhich there were videos instead of images. Working to correct that. Will update after issue is fixed.
